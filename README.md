# Hi!

This repository was created with the aim of storing the processed images and resulting plots I analysed and created for my bachelor thesis. For more than a year I investigated _AGN feedback_ in nearby _giant elliptical galaxies_, particularly its demonstration via the _X-ray cavities_ in _multi-cavity systems_.

I worked with archival _Chandra_ data and did both the spectral and image analysis. In my opinion, it is best to view the images on a screen, and that's why you are here! In the folders denoting each galaxy, you can find its Chandra image and various plots for cavity ages and energetics. 

If you want to read the full thesis, you will find it here: 

If you have any questions, shoot me an email:)
